# Minecraft Economy SImulator
The purpose of this is to Normalise value of each resource in your Minecraft SMP just like IRL foreign exchange market.
This program calculates the amount of resource you will need in exchange of 1 diamond. It will change based on the amount of diamonds
in reserve of your SMP and the abundancy and quantity of corresponding resource.

**For Example**
Currently, you need 20 emeralds in exchange of 1 diamond. And all of the sudden (due to taxes) the SMPs reserve gets filled with Emeralds,
the price of Emeralds will drop with respect to diamonds. Say, 50.

**The value will depend upon following factors:**
1. Quantity of Diamond in the reserve.
2. Quantity of the corresponding resource.
3. Taxes (%).
4. Abundancy of the resource.

For now, it's only backend code. Later I'll also add code of a discord bot to insert the current quantities of resources in the reserve.
